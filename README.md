# react-touch-mouse-handler

> Higher Order Components for touch and mouse events control.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-touch-mouse-handler.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-touch-mouse-handler) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This component is useful for better touchscreen and mouse events recognition. Especially, if you need to handle different actions for hybrid devices.

For example, you have a navigation bar with dropdowns. You need to navigate to some url when clicking on a link, open dropdown menu on hover, as well as open dropdown when tapping the link by finger. Commonly, tapping on hybrid devices opens dropdown for a moment and then navigates to the url defined in the link. Because `click` event follows the `mouseenter` and `touchstart` events. Check all mouse and touch events sequence in my [codepen](https://codepen.io/seleckis/pen/rydXPg) test ground.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-touch-mouse-handler
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import TouchMouseHandler from 'react-touch-mouse-handler';

export default class App extends Component {
    handleAction = (eventType) => {
		if (eventType === 'touch') {
			// do something if it was touch event (tap)
		}
        if (eventType === 'mouse') {
            // do something if it was mouse event (mouseenter)
		}
	}
    render() {
        return (
            <TouchMouseHandler handleAction={this.handleAction}>
                {(events) => (
                    <Button events={events}>Click me</Button>
                )}
            </TouchMouseHandler>
        );
    }
}

```

`TouchMouseHandler` component passes events `onTouchStart`, `onTouchEnd` and `onMouseEnter` to child function. You need to pass them to the child component and then to the DOM element.

```jsx
const Button = ({events}) => (
    <button {...events}>Click me</button>
);
```
